Convert config/infrastructure trees used for gsgen2 to the format required for gsgen3

Usage: $(basename $0) -a AID -p PID

where

(m) -a AID  is the tenant account id e.g. "env01"
    -h      shows this text
(m) -p PID  is the product id for the product e.g. "eticket"

(m) mandatory, (o) optional, (d) deprecated

DEFAULTS:

NOTES:

1. GSGEN3 expects product directories to be the immediate children of the config and infrastructure directories
2. It is assumed we are in the config or infrastructure directory under the AID directory when the script is run
